This google chrome extension can be used to check how much CO2 is emitted when you travel. It automattically adds a header when you go to google maps.

Contribute:

The calculations are done based on EPA.gov estimates of emissions, and do not take into account speed of travel, or elevation changes. If you have suggestions for algrithms to account for these things, I would be very interested.
